						I participated in the Chicago Furniture Show (Casual Market Chicago) sales experience in my
						spare time.
						The exhibition lasted for three days. The exhibit item I was responsible for was an electric
						lift computer desk. <br>Since the product itself has a small audience, in the end, through my
						personal efforts,
						I sold a total of Sold two orders.</span>

				<span>
					I had more than 80 hours of volunteer service experience in
						high school,
						of which volunteering in churches and aid stations were the most frequent,
						accounting for more than half. <br>And what I personally think is the most meaningful
						is that another Jewish community service was provided to survivors of two World War
						II concentration camps. Especially the first one was a blind man.<br> I talked a lot with
						him and listened to him talk about a lot of personal experiences.
